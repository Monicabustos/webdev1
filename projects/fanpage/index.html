            <h3>The Background</h3>
            <p>So if you've seen snipets of this show you can see a lot of drug substances being used. And other's may say it "glorifies" the abuse of drugs. But if you analyze the episodes you can see that in the storyline, that the writes, directors, and actors are trying to tell the audience how different types of mental illnesses can be hidden within a person. Rue is obvious of herdrug addiction. Kat of her commitment issues, Nate is having behaviroal and sexuality issues. And others of that sort. </p>
