    <h1 class>Welcome to the magical garden</h1>
    <h2>Stay a while and relax </h2>
    <h3>Want to escape reality? Or just get away from your boyfriend because he just pushed your last buttons <img src= "gifs/cat_angry.gif">....this is the place for you.</h3>
    
        <h4>Here you can come and hear the birds chirp or lay in our softest clouds. And take a nap before going back to reality. Our fairies are here look after you and to hear you out if you need to talk our your feelings.</h4>
